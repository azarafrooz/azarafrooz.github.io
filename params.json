{"name":"Azarafrooz.GitHub.io","tagline":"A  probabilistic programming language enthusiast","body":"### About me\r\nI completed my PhD at Stevens Institute of Technology, NJ with my thesis dissertation focus on Game Theory, Learning and Complexity Decomposition in Cognitive Networks. Upon my graduation I started a data scientist position in Real Time Intelligence at Pivotal|EMC, Palo Alto CA. In this post I was responsible for the design and implementation of machine learning solutions suitable for the fast data generated from Telecommunications industry. \r\nI designed and implemented an exact online distributed inference algorithm for an infinite hidden markov model using the latest discoveries presented in the paper \"Parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo for Nonparametric Mixture Models\". This project pointed me to next big thing in machine learning, Probabilistic Programming Languages [PPL](http://probabilistic-programming.org/wiki/Home) where I have decided to spend most of my time on at the moment. \r\n\r\n### Research and Industry Interests\r\nMy passion for the better understanding of the randomized algorithms and their novel applications have carried me through various fields of study. From the abstract ideas of avoiding phase transitions in Ising models and graphical game theory, to the novel application of randomized algorithm in cryptography as well as the online inference learning in fast data environments. This path recently brought me to the area of scalable inference in non-parametric Bayesian methods with application in Probabilistic Programming Languages. \r\n\r\n### News\r\nMarch 2015   I was appointed a member of the program committee of big Data and stream analytics workshop at SIAM DATA MINING 2015.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
